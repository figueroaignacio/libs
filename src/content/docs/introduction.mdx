## React Hooks & TypeScript Utilities

A curated collection of production-ready React hooks and TypeScript utilities. Copy, paste, and customize - no dependencies, no installation required.

## Philosophy

This is not a library. It's a collection of code you can copy and adapt to your needs.
Why copy-paste over npm install?

- ðŸŽ¯ Full Control - The code lives in your project, modify it as needed
- ðŸš€ Zero Dependencies - No package maintenance or version conflicts
- ðŸ“¦ No Bundle Bloat - Only copy what you actually use
- ðŸ”§ Learn by Reading - Understand every line of code you use
- âš¡ No Breaking Changes - Your code, your rules

## How It Works

- Browse the documentation to find the hook or utility you need
- Copy the implementation code directly from the docs
- Paste it into your project (e.g., src/hooks/ or src/lib/)
- Customize to fit your specific requirements
- Done - you own the code now

## Quick Example

```tsx
// 1. Copy the hook from the docs
import { useLocalStorage } from "@/hooks/use-local-storage";
import { useDebounce } from "@/hooks/use-debounce";

// 2. Use it in your component
function SearchWithHistory() {
  const [searches, setSearches] = useLocalStorage<string[]>(
    "search-history",
    []
  );
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const debouncedQuery = useDebounce(query, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedQuery && !searches.includes(debouncedQuery)) {
      setSearches([debouncedQuery, ...searches].slice(0, 10));
    }
  }, [debouncedQuery]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      <div>
        <h3>Recent searches:</h3>
        {searches.map((search) => (
          <button key={search} onClick={() => setQuery(search)}>
            {search}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

// 3. Modify the code if needed - it's yours now!
```

## Recommended Setup

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # Copy React hooks here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ use-local-storage.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ use-debounce.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/            # Copy utilities here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cn.ts       # cn() and other utils
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ format-date.tss
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Each Page Includes

Every hook and utility documentation contains:

- âœ… Full TypeScript implementation (ready to copy)
- âœ… Real-world usage examples
- âœ… API reference with parameters and return types
- âœ… Common patterns and edge cases
- âœ… Integration tips

## TypeScript Support

All code is written in TypeScript with:

- Full type safety
- Generic types where appropriate
- JSDoc comments for better IDE hints
- Strict mode compatible

If you're using JavaScript, just remove the type annotations.

## Dependencies Note

Most utilities are dependency-free. A few require common packages:

`cn()` utility needs clsx and tailwind-merge
Date utilities work best with date-fns (but vanilla JS works too)

Dependencies are clearly noted in each documentation page.

## Credits & Inspiration

This collection is inspired by:

- `shadcn/ui` - The copy-paste component philosophy
- `usehooks.com` - React hooks patterns
- `react-use` - Hook implementations

## Have a useful hook or utility to share?

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your implementation with full documentation
3. Submit a pull request

Keep it simple, well-documented, and production-ready.
